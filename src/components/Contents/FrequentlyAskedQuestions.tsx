    },
    {
        question_text: "Q2: Is XXX PDFGPT free to use?",
        answer_text: "A: Yes, at the moment, XXX is completely free to use. You can read PDFs, summarize them, and more without paying a dime. We're doing this to get user feedback and improve the tool, so dive in and give it a try while it's free!",
    },
    {
        question_text: "Q3: What are the limitations of XXX?",
        answer_text: "A: XXX currently works with PDF files only. We don't support other formats yet, but we're building more features to make working with PDFs even easier, like a PDF compressor, splitter, editor, and other tools, and they are all free!",
    },
    {
        question_text: "Q4: How do I use XXX chatbot?",

    },
    {
        question_text: "Q5: Is XXX open-source?",
        answer_text: "A: Yes, XXX is open-source, and we're happy to get contributions from anyone who wants to help. If you have ideas or code to contribute, we'd love to hear from you.",
    },
    {
        question_text: "Q6: Can XXX understand text in images within PDFs?",
        answer_text: "A: Not directly. However, we offer OCR (Optical Character Recognition), which can extract text from images. You can access this feature through the chat interface. It's not built into the AI model itself, but it's a handy workaround when you need to read text from images.",
    },
    {
        question_text: "Q7: How does XXX work?",
        answer_text: "A: XXX uses advanced natural language processing and AI to interact with PDFs. It creates a semantic index for each paragraph, so it can understand the document's structure and content. That’s why it’s so good at finding answers to your questions quickly.",
